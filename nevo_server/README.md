## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Database Migrations

The schema is managed with TypeORM migrations. `synchronize` is off in every
environment, so **the schema is only ever changed by running a migration** —
starting the server will not create or alter tables for you.

Migrations live in `src/migrations/` and run against the connection defined in
`src/data-source.ts`, which reads the same `DB_HOST` / `DB_PORT` / `DB_USER` /
`DB_PASSWORD` / `DB_NAME` variables as the app. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill it in before running any of these.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/<Name>` | Diffs your entities against the current database and writes a new migration file. Needs a reachable database. |
| `npm run migration:run` | Applies every migration that has not been applied yet, oldest first. |
| `npm run migration:revert` | Rolls back the single most recently applied migration. |

Note the `--` before the path on `migration:generate`: without it npm swallows
the argument instead of forwarding it to the TypeORM CLI.

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. install dependencies
$ npm install

# 2. configure the database connection
$ cp .env.example .env   # then edit the DB_* variables

# 3. create an empty database matching that connection, e.g.
$ createdb nevo

# 4. apply all existing migrations
$ npm run migration:run

# 5. start the server
$ npm run start:dev
```

Step 4 is the one new contributors miss. If the app starts but every query
fails with `relation "pools" does not exist`, the migrations have not been run.

### Changing the schema

1. Edit the relevant entity (e.g. `src/pools/pool.entity.ts`).
2. Make sure your local database is already up to date, so the diff only
   contains your change:
   ```bash
   $ npm run migration:run
   ```
3. Generate the migration, passing a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   $ npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/AddCategoryToPools
   ```
   TypeORM prefixes the file with a timestamp, giving
   `src/migrations/1782396384461-AddCategoryToPools.ts`.
4. **Read the generated SQL before committing it.** TypeORM infers intent from
   a schema diff and will happily emit a `DROP COLUMN` where you meant a
   rename, which is silent data loss in production.
5. Apply it locally and confirm the app still works:
   ```bash
   $ npm run migration:run
   ```
6. Commit the migration file alongside the entity change — never one without
   the other.

To undo a migration you have applied locally, `npm run migration:revert` steps
back exactly one migration; run it repeatedly to go further back. Once a
migration is merged and deployed, do not edit it — add a new migration that
corrects it, since anyone who already ran the old one will never re-run it.

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
