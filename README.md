# Lumina: Decentralized Donation Pools on Stellar

Lumina empowers users to create secure, donation pools on the Stellar blockchain. Each pool has a unique address, supporting public or private contributions in XLM, USDC, or custom assets. Funds earn DeFi yields until disbursed to verified causes, with full transparency via Stellarâ€™s ledger. Low-cost (~$0.00001/tx) and fast (3-5s), Lumina redefines charitable giving with trust and scalability.
