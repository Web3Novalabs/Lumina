# Nevo Smart Contract

## Overview

Nevo is a Soroban-based smart contract that enables decentralized donation pools for educational sponsorships. The contract manages the complete lifecycle of funding pools: creation, donations, student applications, approvals, milestone-based disbursements, and fund claims.

### Key Features

- **Donation Pools**: Create and manage funding pools with specific educational goals
- **Student Applications**: Enable students to apply to pools with application data and milestones
- **School Integration**: Link pools to registered schools for application approval workflows
- **Milestone-Based Disbursements**: Support streamed payments through developer-defined milestones
- **Refund Mechanism**: Donors can request refunds after pool deadlines with grace periods
- **Admin Controls**: Platform administrators set fees, register schools, and oversee operations
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event emission for on-chain activity tracking and indexing

## Data Model

### Core Entities

#### Pool

Represents a donation pool for a specific educational cause.

```rust
pub struct Pool {
    pub sponsor: Address,              // Pool creator/administrator
    pub goal: u128,                    // Target funding amount
    pub collected: u128,               // Current amount raised
    pub is_closed: bool,               // Whether pool has been closed
    pub state: PoolState,              // Current state (Active, Paused, Completed, etc.)
    pub application_deadline: u64,     // Timestamp deadline for student applications
}
```

**Pool States:**
- `Active`: Pool is accepting donations and applications
- `Paused`: Pool temporarily halted
- `Completed`: Goal has been reached
- `Cancelled`: Pool was cancelled
- `Disbursed`: Funds have been distributed to students
- `Closed`: Pool is permanently closed

#### Application

Tracks a student's approved funding and disbursement progress.

```rust
pub struct Application {
    pub approved_amount: i128,    // Total amount approved for the student
    pub amount_claimed: i128,     // Amount already withdrawn by the student
}
```

#### Milestone

Represents a payment milestone for streamed disbursements.

```rust
pub struct Milestone {
    pub amount: u128,  // Amount for this milestone
}
```

### Storage Key Namespacing

The contract uses a hierarchical key system to organize persistent storage:

| Key Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `pool_count` | Total number of pools created | Counter for generating pool IDs |
| `p` | Legacy pool data (replaced by direct ID indexing) | Compatibility layer |
| `metadata` | Pool title and description | `("metadata", pool_id)` |
| `pool_school` | School linked to a pool | `("pool_school", pool_id)` |
| `a_count_*` | Application count for a pool | `("a_count_", pool_id)` |
| `a_*` | Individual applications | `("a_", pool_id, app_id)` |
| `ap_*` | Application tracking by student | `("ap_", pool_id, student)` |
| `app_status` | Application approval status | `("app_status", pool_id, student)` |
| `claimed_amount` | Claimed funds tracking | `("claimed_amount", pool_id, student)` |
| `milestones` | Student milestones | `("milestones", pool_id, student)` |
| `pool_deadline` | Pool deadline | `("pool_deadline", pool_id)` |
| `school_reg` | Registered school mapping | `("school_reg", school_address)` |
| `admin` | Platform admin address | "admin" |
| `unclaimed_fees` | Accumulated protocol fees | "unclaimed_fees" |
| `creation_fee` | Pool creation fee | "creation_fee" |

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Pool for a School

1. **Register School** (Admin)
   ```rust
   register_school(env, admin, school_address);
   ```

2. **Create Pool** (Pool Creator)
   ```rust
   let pool_id = create_pool_for_school(
       env,
       creator,
       "STEM Scholarship Fund",
       "Support for underprivileged STEM students",
       100_000_000,  // 100 XLM in stroops
       school_address,
       deadline_timestamp
   );
   ```

3. **Track Donations** (Donors)
   ```rust
   donate(env, pool_id, donor, 5_000_000);
   ```

### Student Application and Funding Flow

1. **Student Applies**
   ```rust
   apply_to_pool(env, pool_id, student, application_data);
   ```

2. **School Approves**
   ```rust
   approve_application(env, pool_id, school, student, true);
   ```

3. **Set Up Milestones** (Student)
   ```rust
   let milestones = Vec::from_array(&env, [
       Milestone { amount: 25_000_000 },
       Milestone { amount: 25_000_000 },
       Milestone { amount: 25_000_000 },
       Milestone { amount: 25_000_000 },
   ]);
   setup_application_milestones(env, pool_id, student, milestones);
   ```

4. **Claim Funds** (Student, in installments)
   ```rust
   claim_funds(env, student, pool_id, 25_000_000, token_address);
   ```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements tracked in GitHub issues:

- [ ] Dynamic fee configuration
- [ ] Batch donation processing
- [ ] Advanced milestone conditions
- [ ] Integration with external data feeds
- [ ] Multi-signature pool operations
- [ ] Pool transfer functionality
- [ ] Dispute resolution mechanisms

---

## Security Considerations

### Authorization

- All state-changing operations require the appropriate party to sign
- Admin functions are protected by the `set_admin` mechanism
- School-only functions verify school registration

### Arithmetic Safety

- All arithmetic operations use checked methods to prevent overflow
- Numeric tests verify edge cases and boundary conditions

### Timestamp Validation

- Deadlines are validated to be in the future
- Grace periods prevent manipulation of refund eligibility
- Deterministic timestamp helpers used in testing

### Token Handling

- Token transfers are properly validated
- Failed transfers don't corrupt contract state
- Insufficient balance scenarios are handled safely
